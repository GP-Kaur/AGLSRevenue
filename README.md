AIM: To push better retention rates for minority, out-of-state, &amp; foreign students to increase the college revenue.

I was working with the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (AGLS) at Iowa State University in my second semester. The college has been facing some issues with student diversity. So, the Dean of Student Services wanted to know what minority groups are entering the AGLS majors, and how many of them are graduating. He also wanted to know how many in-state, out-of-state, and foreign students are coming in and then graduating, and what tuition dollars the college is earning from them. His major goal was to push better retention rates for minority, out-of-state and foreign students. And also, what a 1% increase in graduation rate for each category (minorities, women, etc) would equate to in dollars.

Challenging parts about this project:
•	The data provided to us was dirty data. It had a lot of missing values; a lot of values were erroneous; there was lack of integration of data i.e. the data was stored in separate places; and also, it consisted of unresolved data i.e. use of a lot of abbreviations.
•	Interactions with students enrolled in AGLS majors.
•	Interactions with faculty at the College of AGLS.
•	Interactions with Dean, Assistant Dean and administrative staff of the college.

The data included records of over 11800 students who attended the AGLS department at Iowa State over the past 10 years. The number of attributes were around 22. Since one of our research question includes the money that the department is (if at all) losing, we added the tuition fee columns in our data and are planning to calculate the total income for the University through tuition fees from each student during their time at Iowa State.
